**Judge Reasoning:** The agent's answer is mostly faithful to the legal facts, but it includes additional information from other sections of the BNS that are not directly relevant to the question about Section 64. The correctness score is high because the agent's answer accurately describes the punishment for rape under Section 64, including the term of imprisonment and the liability to fine.
